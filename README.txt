WHEN IS IT ENOUGH?
INVESTIGATING PYTHIA MODELS’ ABILITY TO COMPLETE INDUCTION TASKS
LANGUAGE MODELING AND HUMAN COGNITION COURSE (2024)
  
AUTHORS: Simone Baratella, Kassandra Briola, Samuele Antonelli


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

- Download the ¨Models.zip¨ file and extract the codes
- Install the transformers and Pytorch libraries
	

RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:

- Run the code for the preferred model (we suggest 410m for fast but informative testing)
- Wait for the download to finish
- Ask your question
- The bigger models (2.8b/6.9b/12b) require high computational power and disk space

There are two ¨Grading Table¨ files. The ¨Google version¨ has been modified to work correctly with Google Sheets, while the ¨Excel version¨ is the original table. 
We recommend using the Excel version with the appropriate programme. 
In any case, it is best to avoid opening files with the wrong application to avoid errors in the display of tables and graphs.
